/*Bubble sort, also referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through 
 * the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass 
 * through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
